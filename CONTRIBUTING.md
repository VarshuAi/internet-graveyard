## 🏛️ Archaeological Inclusion Criteria

Before submitting a new defunct entity or proposing an obituary update, ensure the candidate meets our archival standards:

1. **Definitive Cessation**: The service, app, or website must be officially shut down, abandoned, delisted, or acquired and functionally dismantled.
2. **Historical Significance**: The platform possessed a notable user base, introduced novel web mechanics, shaped internet culture, or served as a technological milestone.
3. **Verifiable Sources**: Sunset dates, peak reach metrics, and cause of death must be corroborable via primary sources (press releases, founder letters, Wayback Machine snapshots, news coverage).
4. **Non-Partisan Autopsy**: Coroner findings and fatal flaws must remain neutral, factual, and analytical rather than speculative.
